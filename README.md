# Odin_Project_9_TicTacToe

1. based on this Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe

2. using Factory Functions or Module pattern to create a tic-tac-toe game.

3. icon attribute:

    o icon - <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/o" title="o icons">O icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</a>
    x icon - <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/x" title="x icons">X icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</a>

4. Got the basic game to work (start, win, draw, reset) with clear styling to indicate game state (win or draw). Understood the use of factory functions to organize code. Stop the development now to focus on the rest of the course. Can return back to add the enhance the UX:
    - add player input (name, marker selection).
    - function and display to add player score tally and total game played.
    - add message box (to announce winner or draw game).
    - add button to start/reset game.
